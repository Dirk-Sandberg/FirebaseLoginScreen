The package modules are written using the framework for cross-platform development of <Kivy>.
Information about the <Kivy> framework is available at http://kivy.org.

An example of usage (note that with this import the native implementation of toasts will be used for the Android platform and implementation on Kivy for others:

```python
from toast import toast

...

# And then in the code, toasts are available
# by calling the toast function:
toast ('Your message')
```

To force the Kivy implementation on the Android platform, use the import of the form:

```python
from toast.kivytoast import toast
```
